#Martha: Question: are we to assume that if someone adds a resource, it will be
# immediately distributed across camps, on the assumption
#that we probably won't want volunteers to just be storing resources ?
#This influences the logic of distribution quite a lot.
#E.g. amount left will only be amount left per camp.
