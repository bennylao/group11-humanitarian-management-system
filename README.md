This application is created by Group 11.

%description% blablabla

The core features of this application can be run without installation. 
**However, without installation, the data visualisation feature will not work and could lead to unexpected error.**
Hence, it is recommended to install our application through pip install, and run our app through the command shown below.

Note that user **should not** run the app via ```python main.py``` since this will lead to data inconsistency.
(The command ```hmsGroup11``` will use the data stored in python site-package as data source while 
the command ```Python main.py``` will use the data stored in the local package). 
Only use ```python main.py``` when your machine do not have ```pip``` and cannot run ```pip install .```. 
If ```pip: command not found``` error occurs, most of the time it is because of the missing environment variables. 
i.e. python and pip are not in ```PATH```. This can be solved by either reinstall Python and tick the option 
```Add Python to PATH```, or manually add Python and pip to ```PATH```.

After installation, the application can be accessed in any directory at anytime with the command:
```shell
hmsGroup11
```
